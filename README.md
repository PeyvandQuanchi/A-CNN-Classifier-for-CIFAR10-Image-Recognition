# A-CNN-Classifier-for-CIFAR10-Image-Recognition
CIFAR-10 VisionNet is a convolutional neural network (CNN) built from scratch using TensorFlow/Keras to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. This dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 object categories, including airplanes, cats, cars, and more.

The notebook includes preprocessing steps, model construction, training with data augmentation, and performance visualization.

# Key Concepts
* CIFAR-10 classification using a custom CNN

* Data Augmentation for better generalization
