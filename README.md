# CIFAR-10 VisionNet - Convolutional Neural Network for Image Classification

**CIFAR-10 VisionNet** is a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built from scratch using TensorFlow/Keras to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. This dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 object categories, including airplanes, cats, cars, and more. The project focuses on creating a deep learning model capable of accurately recognizing and classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset using a custom CNN architecture.

## Overview

CIFAR-10 VisionNet takes the CIFAR-10 dataset as input and uses a convolutional neural network to classify the images into one of the 10 predefined categories. The model is constructed from scratch and trained with several techniques aimed at improving performance and generalization. 

### Features:
- **Custom CNN Architecture**: The network is designed specifically for image classification tasks on the CIFAR-10 dataset. It utilizes convolutional layers, pooling layers, and dense layers to extract features and classify images.
- **Data Augmentation**: Data augmentation techniques are applied to the training dataset to artificially increase the size of the dataset and improve the model's ability to generalize. This helps prevent overfitting and enhances the model's robustness.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: The model is trained using TensorFlow/Keras, and training progress is visualized through accuracy and loss plots. The model's performance is also evaluated across the 10 classes in the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- **Efficient Training with TensorFlow Dataset API**: The TensorFlow Dataset API is used to load and manage the data efficiently, ensuring smooth and fast training even with large datasets.

## Key Concepts

- **CIFAR-10 Classification**: The model is designed to classify images into 10 categories: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck. Each category contains thousands of 32x32 pixel images in color.
  
- **Data Augmentation**: This technique involves applying random transformations (such as rotations, shifts, flips, etc.) to the training data. This artificially increases the dataset's size, which helps prevent overfitting and improves the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.
  
- **Model Evaluation**: After training, the modelâ€™s performance is evaluated using accuracy and loss plots. These plots allow you to visualize how the model improves over time, and also indicate how well it generalizes to new data. By analyzing these plots, you can assess whether further optimization or hyperparameter tuning is needed.

- **TensorFlow Dataset API**: The TensorFlow Dataset API is used to handle data preprocessing and to feed data to the model efficiently. This ensures faster and more scalable training, particularly for large datasets.

## Model Architecture

The model is composed of the following layers:

1. **Convolutional Layers**: These layers apply convolution operations to the image, extracting important features such as edges, textures, and shapes.
2. **Max Pooling Layers**: After convolution, max pooling is applied to reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps and decrease the computational complexity.
3. **Fully Connected Layers**: Once features have been extracted, the fully connected layers classify the image into one of the 10 categories based on the learned features.
4. **Softmax Layer**: The final layer is a softmax activation function, which outputs a probability distribution over the 10 possible classes for each input image.

## Dataset

The **CIFAR-10** dataset consists of 60,000 color images in 10 classes with 6,000 images per class. The images are 32x32 pixels and contain the following categories:

- Airplane
- Automobile
- Bird
- Cat
- Deer
- Dog
- Frog
- Horse
- Ship
- Truck

The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.
